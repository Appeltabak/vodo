# Vodo
A simple TODO app made as an exercise to learn Vala

## Setup
Vodo has the following dependencies:

```
gtk+-3.0
```

Vodo uses Meson to build the application. Make sure it's installed on your system
and execute the following command to setup the build system:

```
$ meson build
```

Then `cd` to the created `build` directory and run this command:

```
$ ninja
```
